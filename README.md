# Spicetify Romaji
Spicetify extension to convert Japanese songs to Romaji

## Usage
The usage is pretty simple. Install the `romaji.js` extension according to the instructions at the [Spicetify CLI Wiki](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Extensions).

Then install the dependencies with `yarn install` and run the server with `node server.js`.

I suggest using the packages [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) and [forever-service](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever-service) to make the `server.js` file run at boot.
